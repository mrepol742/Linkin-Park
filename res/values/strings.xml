<string name="b">"The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find
And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

The colors conflicted
As the flames, climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down
And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

You told me yes
You held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down, when I kissed that ring
You lost that right, to hold that crown
I built you up, but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

<string name="g">"Put 'em up like this
Let me see 'em now, yeah
I like that
Yeah

This is not the end
This is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot
Rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone
And the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady
Something empty's within 'em

We say, yeah
Fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something
That's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of
The pain and the fear
Until we tell it, forget it
Let it all disappear

Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control

Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

I know what it takes to move on
(Oh) I know how it feels to lie
(Oh) all I wanna do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

I know what it takes to move on
(Oh) I know how it feels to lie
(Oh) all I wanna do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

Yeah, yeah
What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on
And I don't even know what kind of things I've said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So, picking up the pieces, now where to begin?
The hardest part of ending is starting again

All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

This is not the end
This is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot
Rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone (holding on to what I haven't got)
And the violent rhythm
Though the words sound steady
Something empty's within 'em

We say, yeah
With fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something
That's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of (holding on to what I haven't got)
The pain and the fear
Until we get it, forget it
Let it all disappear

The cold comes, racing through my skin
Searching for a way to get to you
Through the storm you
Go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you've known
You are not alone

With arms up, stretched into the sky
With eyes like, echoes in the night
Hiding from the hell that you've been through
Silent one, you
Go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you've known

You go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you've known

<string name="k">"I remember black skies
The lightning all around me
I remember each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

There was nothing inside
The memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

In every loss in every lie
In every truth that you deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know
Wasted it all just to watch you go
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme
To remind myself of a time when
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

<string name="s">"I cannot take this anymore
I'm saying everything I've said before
All these words they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Less I hear the less you'll say
But you'll find that out anyway
Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break

I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I find bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
Just like before

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to, break

Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up, I'm about to break!

Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break

<string name="w">"I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static, and put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
Even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

I'm with you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong I pretend that the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
So, even though you're close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

Even when I close my eyes

I'm with you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

No, no matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
With you

You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)

Even when I close my eyes

<string name="a1">"Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self control I fear is never ending
Controlling
I can't seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced
That there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem

To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence I'm convinced
That there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal

Under the sky of dust
A constant wave of tension
On top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me
I learned were never true

Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

Paper bags and angry voices
Under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension
Has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action
These words were never true

Now I find myself in question
They point the finger at me again
Guilty by association
You point the finger at me again

I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind

I'm gonna run away, and never say goodbye

<string name="a4">Be Myself</string>
<string name="a5">"What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again
By myself (myself)

I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself (myself)
I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on
To what I want when I'm stretched so thin
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
To end things watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'till everything is gone
If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer
By myself (myself)

I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself (myself)
I ask why, but in my mind
I find I can't rely on myself

To end things watching everything spin
With thoughts of failure sinking in

How do you think
I've lost so much
I'm so afraid
I'm out of touch
How do you expect
I will know what to do
When all I know
Is what you tell me to

Don't you
I can't tell you how to make it
No matter what I do
How hard I
I can't seem to convince myself
I'm stuck on the outside
Don't you
I can't tell you how to make it
No matter what I do
How hard I
I can't seem to convince myself
I'm stuck on the outside

I can't hold on
(To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
(To anything watching everything spin)
Without some failure sinking

Damn, I'm back yep, my soul ain't sell, kept respect up the vets stay their.
Let the best be the tale they tell, that

And these promises broken deep below

So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go, go, go

I finally let you go
I finally let you

Test my will, test my heart
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Y'all go hard, I go smart
How's it working out for y'all in the back, huh?
I've seen that frustration
Been crossed and lost and told no
And I've come back unshaken
Let down and lived and let go
So you can let it be known
I don't hold back, I hold my own
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned
I can't c-flat, it ain't my tone
I can't fall back, I came too far
Hold myself up and love my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
'Cause I was there saying

So one last lie I can see through

Go, go, go

Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band explored other genres on their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight (2007).

The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third-best debut week of any album that year.

The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types in their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. 

Their fifth album, Living Things (2012), combines musical elements from all of their previous records. 

Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound. 

Their seventh album One More Light, a more electronic and pop-oriented record, was released on May 19, 2017.

In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new millennium.Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart.

In 2012, the band was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1.

In 2014, the band was declared as the Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now by Kerrang!.

As the best-selling band of the 21st century and one of the world's best-selling music artists overall, Linkin Park has sold more than 70 million albums worldwide and has won two Grammy Awards."</string>

<string name="a17">"From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care

There's a place so dark you can't see the end
(Skies cock back) and shock that which can't defend
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes shut looking thought the rust and rotten dust
A spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and its dark again

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Moving all around
Screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
The wheels go 'round and the sunset creeps past the
Street lamps, chain-link, and concrete
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn
Floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone
The memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that
I see it right through you

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you

Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end
You'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away

I've tried like you
To do everything you wanted too
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you

Everything falls apart

Everything has to end

We're all out of time, this is how we find how it all unwinds

Now I see your testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away

Pushes me away

<string name="b2">Pushing Me Away</string>
<string name="b3">"Why does it feel like night today?
Something in the air's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(It watches everything)
So I know now when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right beneath my skin

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside too
Your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first but I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter is
I can't add up to what you can but
Everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(It watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you too
Right inside your skin

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

<string name="b5">"I watch how the moon
sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
And the sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's going to owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do
Favors and then rapidly, you just
Turn around and start asking me about
Things you want back from me
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

Maybe someday I'll be just like you and
Step on people like you do and
Run away the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm used to be strong
Used to be generous but you should've known
That you'd
Wear out your welcome now you see
How quiet it is all alone
I'm so
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I'm so
Sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away
You try to take the best of me
Go away

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

Shut up

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place, to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

But nobody can save me now
I’m holding up a light
Chasing up the darkness inside

I chose a false solution

Tell me I’m forgiven

<string name="b18">"So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

Live from the rhythm, it's
Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye

Goodbye, good riddance
A period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate
Maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hail date
Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Showin' out, she in rare form
Wings up, now I'm airborne
King Push, they got a chair for him
Make way for the new queen
The old lineup, where they cheer for 'em
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Were you there for him?
Did you care for him?
You were dead wrong

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)

Yo
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoe’s
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's, gang

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye

The lights are on but nobody's home (nobody's home)

But you're not giving me a chance
When you leave me, where do you go? (Where do you go?)

All the walls that you keep building

<string name="b20">"I got a long way to go
And a long memory
I've been searching for an answer
Always just out of reach
Blood on the floor
Sirens repeat
I've been searching for the courage
To face my enemies

When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

They say that I don't belong
Say that I should retreat
That I'm marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse

When they turn down the lights
I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground
If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground

When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down

<string name="c2">"I don't like my mind right now
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah, I drive myself crazy
'Cause I can’t escape the gravity

I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

You say that I'm paranoid
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me
It's not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same

I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything’s about me

Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Why is everything so heavy?
Why is everything so heavy?

Watching the raindrops blinking red and white
Thinking are you back on the ground
There with a fire burning in your eyes
I only halfway apologize

And I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
Sometimes things refuse to go the way we planned
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day that you will understand
You will understand

After a while you may forget
But just in case the memories cross your mind
You couldn't know this when I left
Under the fire of your angry eyes
I never wanted to say goodbye

So I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
Sometimes things refuse to go the way we planned
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day that you will understand
You will understand

Yeah, stop telling 'em to pump the bass up
Tried to call home but nobody would wake up
Switch your time zones can't pick the bass up
I just passed out by the time you wake up
Best things come to those who wait
And it's time to get pumped on any road you take
Don't ever have a problem make no mistake
I can't wait to come back when I'm going away

I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There are things we have to do that we can't stand
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day that you will understand
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There are things we have to do that we can't stand
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day that you will understand
You will understand
You will understand

<string name="c4">"I scream at myself when there’s nobody else to fight
I don’t lose, I don’t win, if I’m wrong, then I’m halfway right
Used to get high with the dead end kids
Abandoned houses where the shadows live
I never been higher than I was that night
I woke up driving my car
I couldn’t see then what I see right now
The road dissolving like an an empty vow
Couldn’t remember where I’ve been that night
I knew that I took it too far

All you said to do was slow down
I remember, now I remember
All you said to do was slow down
But I was already gone

I scream at myself when there’s nobody else to fight
I don’t lose, I don’t win, if I’m wrong, then I’m halfway right
I know what I want, but It feels like I’m paralyzed
I don’t lose, I don’t win, if I’m wrong, then I’m halfway right

Told me kid you’re going way too fast
You burn too bright, you know you’ll never last
It was bullshit then, I guess it makes sense now
I woke up driving my car
Said I'd lose you if I lost control
I just laughed because what do they know?
Here I am, standing all alone
Because I took it too far

All you said to do was slow down
I remember, now I remember
All you said to do was slow down
But I was already gone

I scream at myself when there’s nobody else to fight
I don’t lose, I don’t win, if I’m wrong, then I’m halfway right
I know what I want, but It feels like I’m paralyzed
I don’t lose, I don’t win, if I’m wrong, then I’m halfway right, halfway right

I scream at myself when there’s nobody else to fight
I don’t lose, I don’t win, if I’m wrong, then I’m halfway right

I scream at myself when there’s nobody else to fight
I don’t lose, I don’t win, if I’m wrong, then I’m halfway right

<string name="c5">"Should've stayed, were there signs, I ignored?
Can I help you, not to hurt, anymore?
We saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep
There are things that we can have, but can't keep

If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In a sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
We're quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well I do

The reminders pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there

If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out?
In a sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out?
If a moment is all we are
We're quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?

Who cares if one more light goes out?
In a sky of a million stars

<string name="c6">"Mama always told me don’t you run
Don’t you run with scissors, son
You’re gonna hurt someone
Mama told me look before you leap
Always think before you speak, and watch the friends you keep

Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

Sharp edges have consequences
I guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences
Now every scar is a story I can tell

Should’ve played safer from the start
Loved you like a house of cards
Let it fall apart
But all the things I couldn’t understand
Never could’ve planned
They made me who I am

Put your nose on paperbacks
Instead of smoking cigarettes
These years you’re never getting back

Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

Sharp edges have consequences
I guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences
Now every scar is a story I can tell

We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger
We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger

Ooh
Stay along the beaten path, never listened when she said

Sharp edges have consequences
I guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences
Now every scar is a story I can tell

We all fall down
We live somehow
We learn what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger
We all fall down

We learn what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger, ooh

<string name="c10">"When this began,
I had nothing to say 
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused)
And I let it all out to find that I'm not the only person with these things in mind (inside of me)
But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I got left to feel (nothing to lose)
Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own,
And the fault is my own

I want to heal, I want to feel,
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain I felt so long (erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I want to heal, I want to feel
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face (I was confused) 
Looking everywhere only to find that it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind (so what am I?)
What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me (nothing to lose)
Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own,
And the fault is my own

I want to heal, I want to feel,
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain I've held so long (erase all the pain 'till it's gone)
I want to heal, I want to feel
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel,
Anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be
Anything 'til I break away from me
And I will break away, and find myself today

I want to heal, I want to feel
What I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain I felt so long (erase all the pain til it's gone)
I want to heal, I want to feel,
Like I'm close to something real
I want to find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

I want to heal I want to feel like I'm,

I want to heal I want to feel like I'm somewhere I belong

<string name="c11">"Memories consume like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume
I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

Clutching my cure
I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more than any time before
I have no options left again
I don't want to be the one the battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize that I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity to show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean

<string name="c12">"I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing too
But I know you were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
By becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be

And whatever pain may come

Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind

Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose

Truth is you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug a trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere

Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out
Digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out
Go, stop the show
Choppy words in a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load

Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse

Can't contain him;
He knows he works
Fuck this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing

And I know that I won't be satisfied
So, why try ignoring him?
Make it a dirty dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

Digging deeper just to throw it away

Digging deeper just to throw it away

Digging deeper just to throw it away

I've pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now

<string name="d11">"Turn my mic up louder
I got to say something
Lightweights stepping aside,
When we come in
Feel it in your chest
The syllables get pumping
People on the street
They panic and start running
Words on loose leaf
Sheet complete coming
I jump on my mind
I summon the rhyme I'm dumping
Healing the blind
I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways
We march to the drumming
Jump when they tell us
They want to see jumping
Fuck that, I want to
See some fist pumping
Risk something
Take back what's yours
Say something that you know
They might attack you for
'Cause I'm sick of being treated
Like I had before
Like it's stupid standing for
What I'm standing for
Like this war is really just
A different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater the rich
And an abandon the poor
Like they understand you
In the back of the jet
When you can't put gas in your tank
These fuckers are laughing their way
To the bank and cashing their check
Asking you to have compassion and to have some respect

For a leader so nervous
In an obvious way
Stuttering and mumbling
For nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world
Watching at the end of the day
In the living room laughing
Like what did he say?

Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen

In my living room watching
But I am not laughing
'Cause when it gets tense
I know what might happen
The world is cold
The bold men take action
Have to react
Or get blown into fractions
Ten years old is something to see
Another kid my age drugged under a jeep
Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he thought the next one could be me
Do you see?
The soldiers they're out today
That brush the dust from bulletproof vests away
It's ironic
At times like this you pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday
There's bombs in the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your markets, your shops, your clothes
My dad, he's got a lot of fear I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show
My brother had a book he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine
In the back he hand wrote a quote inside
When the rich wage war, it's the poor who die

Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stuttering and mumbling
For nightly news to replay
And the rest of the world
Watching at the end of the day
Both scared and angry
Like what did he say?

Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen

<string name="d16">"Water gray
Through the windows, up the stairs
Chilling rain
Like an ocean everywhere
Don't wanna reach for me, do you?
I mean nothin' to you
The little things give you away
And now there will be no mistakin'
The levees are breakin'

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under water
I do

Hope decays
Generations disappear
Washed away
As a nation simply stares

Don't wanna reach for me do you
I mean nothin' to you
The little things give you away
But there will be no mistakin'
The levees are breakin'

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under water
I do
All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under ground now
Now I
Now I do

Little things give you away
Little things give you away
Little things give you away
Little things give you away

All you've ever wanted (Little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (Little things give you away)
All you've ever wanted (Little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (Little things give you away)
All you've ever wanted (Little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (Little things give you away)
All you've ever wanted (Little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (Little things give you away)
All you've ever wanted (Little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (Little things give you away)
All you've ever wanted (Little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (Little things give you away)

<string name="d17">"Take me down to the river bend 
Take me down to the fighting end 
Wash the poison from off my skin 
Show me how to be whole again 

Fly me up on a silver wing 
Past the black where the sirens sing 
Warm me up in a nova's glow 
And drop me down to the dream below 

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass 
Hardly anything there for you to see 
For you to see 

Bring me home in a blinding dream 
Through the secrets that 
I have seen 
Wash the sorrow from off my skin 
Show me how to be whole again 

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass 
Hardly anything there for you to see 
For you to see 

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass 
Hardly anything else I need to be 

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass 
Hardly anything there for you to see 
For you to see 
For you to see

<string name="d19">"When you were standing in the wake of devastation 
When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown 
And with the cataclysm raining down, insides crying save me now 
You were there impossibly alone 

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation 
You build up hope but failure's all you've known Remember all the sadness and frustration 
And let it go, let it go 

And in the burst of light that blinded every angel 
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars 
You felt the gravity of temper grace falling into empty space 
No one there to catch you in their arms 

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation 
You build up hope but failure's all you've known Remember all the sadness and frustration 
And let it go, let it go 

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation 
You build up hope but failure's all you've known Remember all the sadness and frustration 
And let it go 

Let it go 
Let it go 
Let it go 
Let it go

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation 
You build up hope but failure's all you've known Remember all the sadness and frustration 
And let it go, let it go

<string name="e1">"Tearing me apart 
With words you wouldn't say 
Suddenly tomorrow's 
Moment washed away 
'Cause I don't have a reason 
And you don't have the time 
We both keep on waiting 
For something we won't find 

The light on the horizon 
Was brighter yesterday 
Shadows floating over 
Skies begin to fade 
You said it was forever 
But then it slipped away 
Standing at the end of 
The final masquerade 

All I ever wanted 
Secrets that you keep 
All you ever wanted 
The truth I couldn't speak 
'Cause I can't see forgiveness 
And you can't see the crime 
And we both keep on waiting 
For what we left behind 

The light on the horizon 
Was brighter yesterday 
Shadows floating over 
Skies begin to fade 
You said it was forever 
But then it slipped away 
Standing at the end of 
The final masquerade 

Final masquerade 
Standing at the end of the final masquerade 

The light on the horizon 
Was brighter yesterday 
Shadows floating over 
Skies begin to fade 
You said it was forever

Standing at the end of

Spinning like a whirlwind, nothing to land on 
Came so far, never thought it'd be done now 
Stuck in a holding pattern waiting to come down 
Oh 

Did somebody else define me? 
Can I put the past behind me? 
Do I even have a decision 
Feeling like I'm living in a story already written 
Am I part of a vision made by somebody else? 
Pointing fingers at villains but 
I'm the villain myself 
Or am I out of conviction with no wind in the sail? 
Too focused on the end and simply ready to fail 

'Cause I'm tired of the fear that I can't control this I'm tired of feeling like every next step's hopeless 
I'm tired of being scared what I build might break apart 
I don't want to know the end, all I want is a place to start 
Oh, oh 
I don't want to know the end, all I want is a place to start 
Oh, oh 

Hey Mike, uh, just calling to uh, you know, send my condolences 
Hey man, it's Mark, just calling to check in on you, see how you're doing 
What up Mike? Just calling to see how you're doing, check in with you a little bit 
Wanna obviously send my love and support and, um, just let you know I'm here for you 
I know you're super busy, didn't wanna bother you 
Um, just wanted to let you know I'm thinking about you Give me a call back if you want, if not, I guess that too 
Um, but I'm sure I will see you and or talk to you sometime soon 
Alright bud, hope you're hanging in there, see ya

<string name="e16">"Come on!

Sometimes, sometimes you don't say goodbye once
You say goodbye over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Sometimes, sometimes you don’t say goodbye once
You say goodbye over and over and over again
Over and over and over again

It was a month since he passed, maybe less
And no one knew what to do, we were such a mess
We were texting, we were calling, we were checking in
We said we ought to play a show in honor of our friend
Well now that show's finally here, it's tonight
Supposed to go to the bowl, get on stage, dim the lights
With our friends and our family, in his name, celebrate
There's no way that I'll be ready to get back up on that stage
Can't remember if I've cancelled any show
But I think about what I'm supposed to do and I don't know
'Cause I think about not doing it the same way as before
And it makes me wanna puke my fucking guts out on the floor
We rehearsed it for a month, I'm not worried about the set
I get tackled by the grief at times that I would least expect
I know what I should be doing when I'm singing but instead
We'll be playing through a song and I'd remember in my head

Sometimes, sometimes you don't say goodbye once
You say goodbye over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Sometimes, sometimes you don’t say goodbye once
You say goodbye over and over and over again
Over and over and over again

What they saying, I'm not raw?
What the fuck you take me for?
All the sudden you hear what I've said a hundred ways before?
I been pushed, I been trapped
Drug myself through hell and back and
Fallen flat and had the balls to start it all again from scratch
How do you feel, how you doing, how'd the show go?
Am I insane to say the truth is that I don’t know
My body aches heads spinning this is all wrong
I almost lost it in middle of a couple songs
And everybody that I talk to is like, “wow
Must be really hard to figure out what to do now”
Well thank you genius, you think it'll be a challenge
Only my life's work hanging in the fucking balance
And all I wanted was to get a little bit of closure
And every step I took I looked and wasn't any closer
'Cause sometimes when you say goodbye, yeah you say it
Over and over and over and over

Sometimes, sometimes you don't say goodbye once
You say goodbye over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Sometimes, sometimes you don’t say goodbye once
You say goodbye over and over and over again
Over and over and over again

Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over again

<string name="e17">"woah, excuse me while I kiss the sky
Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of lies
Thinking I'm okay, but they're saying otherwise
Tell me how I look but can't look me in the eyes
Watching as I say this and then I do that
Telling them the old words but in a new rap
Then I change my mind up and make them lose track
Shit, I'm inconsistent I thought they knew that

Maybe I should be more grateful
That I had to watch it all come undone
Holding so tight to the edge is painful
But I can't ignore it, I know

They're watching as I fall, they're staring as I go
I gave until my soul hurt, and never told them so
They're watching as I fall, to somewhere down below
But maybe I'm just falling, to get somewhere they won't

to get some

Excuse me while I sympathize
Singing with the fat lady, tell me what's the time
You know what it is not afraid to cross the line
Nothing is forever don't be mad at the design
Ask me if I can, I say I don't know
And honestly I buy that I can sound cold
Still upset from shit that's 15 years old
I don't know what it takes to make me let go

Maybe I should be more grateful
That I had to watch it all come undone
Holding so tight to the edge is painful
But I can't ignore it I know

They're watching as I fall, they're staring as I go
I gave until my soul hurt, and never told them so
They're watching as I fall, to somewhere down below
But maybe I'm just falling, to get somewhere they won't

to get somewhere they won't

They're watching as I fall, they're staring as I go
I gave until my soul hurt, and never told them so
They're watching as I fall, to somewhere down below
But maybe I'm just falling, to get somewhere they won't

to get somewhere they won't
to get somewhere they won't
to get somewhere they won't

<string name="e18">"I used to know where the bottom was
Somewhere far under the ocean waves
Up on a ledge I was looking down
It was far enough to keep me safe
But the ground was cracked open
Threw me in the ocean
Cast me out away at sea
And the waves are still breaking
Now that I awaken
No one's left to answer me

My inside's out, my left is right
My upside's down, my black is white
I hold my breath, and close my eyes
And wait for dawn, but there's no light
Nothing makes sense anymore, anymore
Nothing makes sense anymore, anymore
Nothing makes sense anymore, anymore
Nothing makes sense anymore, anymore

I used to sleep without waking up
In a dream I made from painted walls
I was a moment away from done
When the black spilled out across it all
And my eyes were made sober
World was turned over
Washing out the lines I'd seen
And my heart is still breaking
Now that I awaken
No one's left to answer me

My inside's out, my left is right
My upside's down, my black is white
I hold my breath, and close my eyes
And wait for dawn, but there's no light

I'm a call without an answer
I'm a shadow in the dark
Trying to put it back together
As I watch it fall apart

I'm a call without an answer
I'm a shadow in the dark
Trying to put it back together
As I watch it fall apart

My inside's out, my left is right
My upside's down, my black is white
I hold my breath, and close my eyes
And wait for dawn, but there's no light

Nothing makes sense anymore, anymore
Nothing makes sense anymore, anymore
Nothing makes sense anymore, anymore
Nothing makes sense anymore, anymore

<string name="e19">"Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, oh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you, oh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, oh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you (about you, about you, about you, about you)

This is that gather 'round it and wonder where I found it
This is that wake up make your agent have your tour re-routed
This is that drama comma pain and ain’t no way around it
'Cause somehow still it's hard to know what I can say about it
I buckled up told myself to suck it up
I was scared to death to get up there and spill my fucking guts
I was saying pull your stupid self together buttercup
Get it crackin' 'Back in Black' until you have 'em 'Thunderstruck', but

Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, oh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you, about you

No, there's not a single thing that I can say
Not a single solitary, every meaning changes shape
Even when there's no connection back to you in any line
All of a sudden it's about you and it gets me every time, but
What the fuck is left to author anyway?
When I basically been writin' since the Raiders ran LA
I'm afraid that maybe I've said everything there is to say
Maybe I should make an exit while there're ways to get away

Can't find the words to a memory
But these are just words to a melody
Find something that works fits the symmetry
For only a quick broken remedy
And I'd give anything to choose
Pick out the words I bring home to you
How can I make do?
Put a smile on change my attitude
And even though it' not about you
Everything is all about you, all
All about you

Ooh, even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you (about you)

Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you now, ooh
Even when it's not about you, about you
All of a sudden it's about you, about you, ohh

<string name="e20">"What's the difference between a man and a monster
Is it somewhere between I can and I want to
Is it somewhere between the promises I made
And the fact I couldn't see something getting in the way

I used to think that I know what I want
Never saw it coming unglued
I used to think that I know what I want
Now it's time to see if it's true

I had so much certainty
'Til that moment I lost control
And I've tried but it never was up to me
I've got no worse enemy
Than the fear of what's still unknown
And the time's come to realize there will be
Promises I can't keep

What's the difference between a loss and a forfeit
I tried to make it better, but I made it more sick
I tried to make it right, now awake at night
I know reality was getting in the way

I used to think that I knew who I was
Never saw it coming unglued
I used to think that I knew who I was
Now it's time to see if it's true

I had so much certainty
Til that moment I lost control
And I've tried but it never was up to me
I've got no worse enemy
Than the fear of what's still unknown
And the time's come to realize there will be
Promises I can't keep

I had so much certainty
Til that moment I lost control
And I've tried but it never was up to me
I've got no worse enemy

<string name="f1">"They'll tell you I don't care anymore
And I hope you'll know that's a lie
Cause I've found what I have been waiting for
But to get there means crossing a line

I don't know how to warn you for what I'm gonna say
Cause you're holding so tight to what I'm taking away
I got demons inside me so I'm faced with a choice
Either try to ignore them or I give them a voice

And it's keeping me up at night
Worried it's not alright
Holding back things you don't know
And it's keeping me up at night
Worried it's not alright
You're not gonna like where this goes

And they'll tell you I don't care anymore
And I hope you'll know that's a lie
Cause I've found what I have been waiting for
But to get there means crossing a line
So I'm crossing a line

It's not about status, we know it never was
Cause what good is the kingdom when you're missing the love
This is not a goodbye now, I'm not going away
No I don't have the answers but I do have the faith

And it's keeping me up at night
Worried it's not alright
Holding back things you don't know
And it's keeping me up at night
Worried it's not alright
You're not gonna like where this goes, no

And they'll tell you I don't care anymore
And I hope you'll know that's a lie
Cause I've found what I have been waiting for
But to get there means crossing a line
So I'm crossing a line

And they'll tell you I don't care anymore
And I hope you'll know that's a lie
Cause I've found what I have been waiting for
But to get there means crossing a line

<string name="f2">"She said
This is not about a poltergeist
Not about a phantom that glows at night
But there are things we don’t know and I
Don’t have another choice but an open mind, oh
And I know what they’ll say
I’m trying to make sense of what no one can explain
But I’ve been having dreams that after I’m awake
Play out in reality the very next day

So I play along
I nod my head when they say I’m wrong
But each night falls and away I run
On the other side till the daylight comes
So I play along
I nod my head when they say I’m wrong
But each night falls and away I run
On the other side till the daylight comes

And when the lights go down
I see things I can’t explain
Calling out my name 
The lights go down
Holding every memory close
Tonight is for our ghosts
Ghosts
Ghosts
Tonight is for our ghosts

This is not about you and me
I can’t bring back how it used to be
And I know what I do believe 
But I’ve already seen what I couldn’t see, oh

So I play along
I nod my head when they say I’m wrong
But each night falls and away I run
On the other side till the daylight comes

And when the lights go down
I see things I can’t explain
Calling out my name
The lights go down
Holding every memory close
Tonight is for our ghosts

And when the lights go down
Is there something in the air
There but never there
The lights go down
Holding every memory close
Tonight is for our ghosts
Ghosts
Ghosts
Tonight is for our ghosts
Ghosts
Ghosts
Tonight is for our ghosts

<string name="f3">"I keep on running backwards, I keep on losing faith
I thought I had the answers, I thought I knew the way
My brother said be patient, my mother held my hand
I don't what I'm chasing, I don't know who I am
Woke up this morning holding my head
Thinking last night is one of regret
Washing off the bad decisions, the blurry vision
The clues that I'm still a mess
Spitting out the taste I have in my mouth
Knowing what this all is really about
Knowing there's an explanation, an expiration
I gotta figure shit out

And they're asking me if I can see the darkness down below
And I know it's true, I say I do, and half the time I don't
Maybe I can't make what it may take to leave this thing behind
But I shut my eyes and cross each line and every time

I keep on running backwards, I keep on losing faith
I thought I had the answers, I thought I knew the way
My brother said be patient, my mother held my hand
I don't what I'm chasing, I don't know who I am

Waking in the dead of night, I can't sleep
Sleeping in the light of day for like weeks
Reality was out of focus, I could be hopeless
Instead I gritted my teeth
I didn't have the patience left to explain
Didn't wanna wait while nobody came
I know the path ahead's uneven
But while I'm breathing
I have to make my own lane

And they're asking me if I can see the darkness down below
And I know it's true, I say I do, and half the time I don't
Maybe I can't make what it may take to leave this thing behind
But I shut my eyes and cross each line and every time

I keep on running backwards, I keep on losing faith
I thought I had the answers, I thought I knew the way
My brother said be patient, my mother held my hand
I don't what I'm chasing, I don't know who I am

So I make it up as I go, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
I make it up as I go, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
So I make it up as I go, ooh-oh, oh-oh
I make it up as I go, as I go

Keep on running backwards, I keep on losing faith
I thought I had the answers, I thought I knew the way
My brother said be patient, my mother held my hand
I don't what I'm chasing, I don't know who I am

So I make it up as I go, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
I make it up as I go, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
So I make it up as I go, ooh-oh, oh-oh
I make it up as I go, as I go

<string name="f4">"Yeah

Wanna know where I don’t go
When it goes from OK to a oh no
When it goes from hi five to a low blow
When it goes from all five to a solo
Lemme tell you what you don’t know
I been down, so low
I was looking for something but denying that I found it
There’s an elephant sitting in the room
And I can’t find another way to tiptoe around it
I been doing greater good for a long time
But I can’t find any other way to give now
I been putting myself on the sideline
And it’s been time so I’m saying can I live now

There are times when I kick myself
Say I’m not sick but I can’t get well
Say I got this while I chase my tail
As if they can’t tell

I'm running from my shadow
Running from my shadow, but it’s still there chasing me down
I’ll never win the battle
Never win the battle and I should have known it by now
Just when I think I’ve found the end, oh whoa whoa whoa
I’m going back around again, oh whoa whoa whoa
Running from my shadow
Running from my shadow but it’s still there chasing me down

Yeah, yeah
Light side’s got a dark side to it
Daytime flows into night like fluid
The yin and the yang with a curved line through it
And none of it’s illuminating why I do it
Maybe I didn’t want to chase what was not right
Maybe I didn’t want to face you were offsides
Thinking I was far away from a crossed line
But I was giving soft praise to a hard lie
There are things that you say and you don’t say
My tongue’s gotten real tired of me biting it
‘Cause I keep on following the wrong way
Time’s come and I can’t keep denying it
There are times when I kick myself
Say I’m not sick but I can’t get well
Say I got this while I chase my tail
As if they can’t tell

I'm running from my shadow
Running from my shadow but it’s still there chasing me down
I’ll never win the battle
Never win the battle and I should have known it by now
Just when I think I’ve found the end, oh whoa whoa whoa
I’m going back around again, oh whoa whoa whoa
Running from my shadow
Running from my shadow but it’s still there chasing me down

I love you but I know, I gotta let you go
Dancing with the devil 'cause she’s all I’ve ever known
Wanted to pretend, that this time was the end
Sorry, but I guess I gotta let you down again
Again
Again
Running from my shadow, now my shadow is my only friend

Running from my shadow
But it’s still there chasing me down
Yeah
Hey!
Running from my shadow
Running from my shadow, but it’s still there chasing me down

That felt pretty cool

Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop, much less control me
When it rains, it pours, when the floodgates open brace your shores
That pressure don't care when it breaks your doors
Say it's all you can take, better take some more

'Cause I know what it's like to test fate
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight
Stood up strong in spite of that hate

Night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
And I been waiting for it so long

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes

Oh
Oh
Oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

When I was young, they told me, they said
Make your bed, you lie in that bed
A king can only reign 'til instead
There comes that day it's off with his head

The night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
You'll have my mercy then when you're gone

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes

Oh
Oh
Oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

And I told them, nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop, much less control me
When it rains, it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care, it breaks your doors
Say it's all you can take, better take some more

Oh
Oh
Oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes

Oh
Oh
Oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

<string name="g17">"Take me down to the river bend (Take me down to the river bend)
Take me down to the fighting end (Take me down to the fighting end)
Wash the poison from off my skin (Wash the poison from off my skin)
Show me how to be whole again (Show me how to be whole again)

Fly me up on a silver wing (Fly me up on a silver wing)
Past the black where the sirens sing (Past the black where the sirens sing)
Warm me up in the nova’s glow (Warm me up in the nova’s glow)
And drop me down to the dream below (And drop me down to the dream below)

’Cause I’m only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

Take me down to the river bend
Take me down to the fighting end
(Wash) Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again (gain gain gain)

Fly me up on a silver wing
Past the black where the sirens sing
(Warm) Warm me up in the nova’s glow
And drop me down to the dream below (low low low)

’Cause I’m only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
For you to see

For you to see
For you to see
For you to see
For you to see

’Cause I’m only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
’Cause I’m only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see

For you to see
For you to see
For you to see
For you to see

For you to see
For you to see
For you to see
For you to see

For you to see
For you to see
For you to see

’Cause I’m only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
’Cause I’m only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see

<string name="g18">"And these promises broken
Deep below.
Each word gets lost in the echo.
So, one last lie I can see through.
This time I finally let you go, go, go.

I finally let you go!

This time I finally let you—

Test my will, test my heart,
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up.
Y'all go hard, I go smart.
How's that working out for y'all in the back, huh?
I've seen that frustration.
Been crossed and lost and told, No.
And I've come back unshaken.
Let down and lived and let go.

So you can let it be known.
I don't hold back, I hold my own.
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned.
I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone.
I can't fall back, I came too far.
Hold myself up and love my scars.
Let the bells ring wherever they are
'Cause I was there saying...

And these promises broken
Deep below.
Each word gets lost in the echo.
So one last lie I can see through.
This time I finally let you go, go, go, go.

Oh, oh, oh.

This time I—

This time I—

This time I—

This time I—

This time I—

This time I finally let you go!

This time I finally let you—

Go, go

Promises, promises. [repeat]

And these promises broken
Deep below.
Each word gets lost in the echo.
So one last lie I can see through.
This time I finally let you go, go, go, go.

They're acting like they want a riot, it's a riot I'll give 'em

For you snakes in the grass supplying the venom
I ain't scared of your teeth, I admire what's in 'em
You been waiting in the shadows there, thinking you're hidden
But the truth is you don't have the stomach to get 'em
Go on already, hit 'em, yeah you gotta be kidding
Wanna talk about a victim? Imma put you there with 'em

<string name="g20">"Like shining oil, this night is dripping down
Stars are slipping down, glistening
And Im trying not to think what Im leaving now
No deceiving now, its time you let me go
Let me go

Ill be gone!
Ill be gone!

King Push
Dope game keep callin'
Dope boys keep fallin'
Askin' me What's my legacy?
I just wanna die ballin'

I just wanna die pourin'
I just wanna ride foreign
I just wanna bring hoes together
Lonny, Lisa, meet Lauren (Wooo!)

Then I be gone, keep it movin', what I be on
Damn right I know what time it is
Patek Philippe and the Tourbillion (Yuugh!)
I'm stylin' on 'em, I'm swervin' on 'em
I know it's wrong, but life's a bitch and she turn me on!

Yeah, and to each his own
Hatin' aint something that we condone
'Cause the way I flip when the beat come on
I gonna pop that shit 'til your speakers blown

And y'all wanna cop a plea
Who you gon' talk to? Not to me
Because the chain of command work properly
You gotta earn a few stripes 'til you talk to me

Word to Pusha, word to Vice
Built a track once and killed it twice
Built a stage up and killed the lights
Opening act was like Fuck my life

Y'all can love it, aint nothing wrong
Forget the hatin' that y'all be on
Enjoy it now because after long
Keyser Söze, I'll be gone

Ill be gone!
Ill be gone!

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence, Ill be gone
Ill be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, Ill be gone
Ill be gone

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence, Ill be gone
Ill be gone
Ill be gone!

Ill be gone!

Ill be gone!

Say it's all you can take, better take some more
